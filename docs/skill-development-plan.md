Python/Go/Java –
Mastering Python, Go, and Java makes you stack-agnostic—able to pick the right tool for any layer of a system while deepening core engineering fundamentals.
Widely used across backend services, API development, scripting (DevOps), and cryptographic implementations.

## Goals

By May 2026, build a production-ready microservice in Go handling 1,000+ concurrent requests using goroutines and channels, validated via load testing (k6) and documented in a GitHub repo.
By April 2026, implement a secure REST API in Java (Spring Boot) with JWT authentication and rate limiting, deployed to AWS EC2 and tested via Postman collections.

Planning
Resources: Go in Action (book), Udemy’s Java Spring Boot Masterclass, and Python’s official docs for async/await patterns.

Timeline:
Weeks 1–4: Complete Go concurrency labs (e.g., worker pools) using The Go Programming Language exercises.
Weeks 5–8: Build Java Spring Boot API with Auth0 integration; deploy to AWS via CI/CD (GitHub Actions).
Weeks 9–12: Optimize Python script performance (e.g., async I/O for Telegram bot integration) and document trade-offs.
Practice: 10 hrs/week coding; weekly PRs to GitHub; pair-programming sessions with peers on real-world scenarios (e.g., debugging cache invalidation).

Tracking
Metrics:
Goal 1: k6 test results showing 95%+ success rate at 1,000 RPS; 5+ merged PRs with concurrency fixes.
Goal 2: Postman test suite passing 100% of auth/rate-limiting cases; AWS deployment logs with <2% error rate.
Checkpoints: Biweekly code reviews with a mentor; monthly progress journal tracking time spent per language.
Evaluation: Compare pre/post-goal project complexity (e.g., LOC reduced by 20% via idiomatic patterns); pass/fail on deployment to production-like environments.
